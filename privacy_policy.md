## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Compressor** app ("the App") handles user data. The App is developed by an individual developer, Suhail N, and is provided as a free service. This policy outlines our commitment to user privacy and data security.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

We do **not** collect, store, or share any personal data from our users. All compression and file handling activities occur **locally** on the user's device. We do not track, log, or transmit user data to any external servers.

## 3. Advertising

The App displays ads through **Google AdMob** to support its free usage. Users may choose to watch ads to increase their compression limit. If a user does not wish to watch ads, they can continue using the app without additional benefits. Ad services may collect anonymized data to provide personalized ad experiences. For more details on Google's data collection, please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App integrates **Google AdMob** for displaying advertisements. These services may collect non-personally identifiable information to improve ad targeting. We do not control the data collected by these services. Users can manage their ad preferences through their Google account settings.

## 5. Data Security

Since we do not collect or store any user data, there is no risk of unauthorized access to personal information. All processing is done locally on the user's device.

## 6. User Rights

As no personal data is collected, there is no need for users to request data access, deletion, or modifications. Users can uninstall the App at any time if they no longer wish to use it.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. Any changes will be reflected in this document with an updated effective date. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically.
